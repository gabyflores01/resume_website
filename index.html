        <p> I am an aspiring journalist with experience covering breaking news and extensive features on communities. For current or arising issues, I can offer effective and practical solutions. I diligently complete all tasks effectively and apply my collaborative, leadership skills in team projects. As a bilingual communicator, I fluently speak Spanish and am interested in reporting for English, Spanish, or bilingual outlets. Open to reporting, writing, and audio opportunities available in the NYC area. </p>
